              Hi! I'm an environmental researcher and visual artist based in Jaödeogë/Pittsburgh
              and Tkaronto/Toronto. I'm originally from Gyeonggi, Korea, but my family
              immigrated twice&mdash;first to Singapore, then to Coast Salish Territories/Vancouver.
              I've also lived in Tiohtià:ke/Montreal as an undergrad at McGill University,
              where I studied Honours Mechanical Engineering and spent my summers setting fire to aluminum dust
              suspensions (for science).
            </p>

            <p class="hero__intro">
              I'm currently doing a PhD at Carnegie Mellon University's Department of 
              <a href="https://epp.engineering.cmu.edu/about/index.html">Engineering and Public Policy</a>, 
              advised by Professors <a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/karplus-valerie.html">Valerie Karplus</a> 
              and <a href="https://scholars.cmu.edu/3777-nicholas-muller">Nicholas Muller</a>. My work 
              investigates the climate change, air quality, and environmental justice impacts of
              industrial decarbonization pathways, focusing on high-energy-demand industries 
              such as iron and steel production and data centers. 
              I became interested in industrial decarbonization through
              my time in engineering consulting, where I worked on design and process solutions for the mining and metals industry and spent time at
              steel and nickel plants in Canada, Asia, and Central/South America doing site work.
            </p>

            <p class="hero__intro">
              I've been making art since long before I even knew what engineering was. Painting has
              always been my emotional outlet through many an existential crisis, but recently
              I've been turning to photography as an art form to address many of the same
              questions I research for my PhD: how do we express the intangible effects of
              modernization and industrialization on society? How can we go about trying to balance the immediate
              benefits of modern systems and technologies with their ineffable but undeniable
              human and environmental costs, especially when climate and pollution damages will
              affect some people much more than others based on race, nationality, or wealth?
            </p>

            <p class="hero__intro">
              I've had the privilege of presenting my research at conferences and invited talks, 
              and showing my art in exhibitions, community events, and magazines. Learn more on this 
              website, or contact me through the links below.
